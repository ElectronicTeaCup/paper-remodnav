Tracking of eye movements during cognitive tasks is an established metric for many types of experimental paradigms in both psychology and cognitive neuroscience. In such experiments, the usage of more complex and lengthier visual stimuli has made algorithmic approaches --- in detecting eye movement events as saccades and fixations --- the most pragmatic option. A recent analysis has revealed that current algorithms for detecting eye movements are lackluster when it comes to processing eye tracking data from subjects viewing dynamic stimuli such as video sequences. We aimed to design an algorithm that has comparable performance to currently used software of the same purpose but also specially tuned to detect different events in data from dynamic stimuli. We compared the output of our algorithm to a data set which had manually annotated events to compare performance with human viewers --- which we consider as the gold standard when it comes to accuracy. In addition, we compared our algorithm to a currently developed one to see if the performance is up to par. After validating its functionality, we applied our algorithm to noisy eye tracking data to see how if the results were biologically feasible. We found that our algorithm performs relatively well and particularly stands out when it comes to the evaluation of data from dynamic stimuli. To establish broad distribution and applicability we provided the option to include individual parameters based on the paradigm and equipment used by the investigator and bundled it into an open-source and well documented repository.

\section*{Introduction}\label{intro}

%\todo[inline]{\textit{make connection to studyforrest. studyforrest has eyetracking data. why is it necessary to have that preprocessed?}}

% The data used for this thesis originates from the open science project 'studyforrest'. It centers around two large data acquisition phases employing the movie 'Forrest Gump' as stimulus. \cite{Hanke.2014,Hanke.2016} The project provides a large variety of collections of data to enable fellow researchers to build upon existing knowledge and further extend the dataset. Along other measures, the eye gaze coordinates were being recorded during the original sessions. Contrarily to the standard automatic detection process we applied an adaptive algorithm to the eye movement data to provide a more precise computation of saccades and fixations. 

A spreading theme in cognitive neuroscience is the usage of dynamic and natural stimuli as opposed to isolated and distinct imagery used in classical studies \citep{real_world}. Using such stimuli we are able to observe the nuances of cognition in a more natural environment. Some interesting applications include the determination of neural response to changes in facial expression \citep{Harris2014}, understanding complex social interactions by using videos \citep{Tikka2012} and more untouched themes such as the underlying processing of music \citep{Toiviainen2014}. \todo{"Quantify the amount of correlation between response and stimuli"?} In these studies, a physical measurement is needed to quantify the amount of correlation between response and stimuli. One measure that is useful and well established for such use cases is data obtained from eye tracking. Eye tracking is a flexible measurement which has proven its worth in a variety of studies ranging from the understanding of visual attention \citep{HantaoLiu2011}, memory \citep{Hannula2010} and language comprehension \citep{Gordon2006}. The raw eye tracking data provided by eye tracking devices however is rarely used "as is". Instead, in order to disentangle different cognitive, oculomotor, or perceptive states associated with different types of eye movements, most research relies on a classification of eye gaze data into distinct eye movements categories (TODO: this needs a citation). \\
Our interest is the usage of eye gaze data as obtained from eye tracking from the studyforrest dataset--- a dataset containing a variety of outputs from subjects viewing natural and dynamic stimuli in the form of a full length movie \citep{Hanke2016}. The available eye gaze data in this dataset stems from a high-quality laboratory recording, but also from simultaneous eye-tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisition in the bore of an MRI scanner with higher spatial uncertainty and noise level. We considered the latter gaze data to be especially precious, as the joint analysis of fMRI and eye tracking data opens up a number of additional insights and research endeavors. \todo{maybe list examples of what we did. maybe crossreference to bookchapter in progress} In order to effectively use this eye gaze data, we searched for a robust algorithm that would help us sort out different eye related events, namely, saccades, fixations, post-saccadic oscillations, and smooth pursuit obtained during movie watching, even under high noise levels. As advocates of open-source software and scientific reproducibility we focused on non-commercial algorithms that were both well documented (published works) and freely available. Conveniently, a recent study \citep{Andersson2017} took on the task of evaluating ten contemporary eye gaze event detection algorithms on different sets of stimuli and compared them to human "coders" --- which were human participants who marked events in eye gaze data on a GUI. While the algorithms worked well for static stimuli, to our disappointment, the authors concluded that none of the algorithms performed remarkably well when it came to dynamic stimuli. The analysis of eye gaze during dynamic stimulation however can lead to a deeper understanding of behavioral or cognitive processes and is relevant for a multitude of fields, from cognitive neuroscience to cinematography, industrial engineering and human-computer interactions, or marketing \citep{Duchowski2002}. Thus, algorithms capable of event detection for eye gaze data from dynamic stimuli are desirable and would be broadly applicable beyond our own use case. \\

In order to develop an improved event detection algorithm, we started by looking at an already established algorithm. One of the most successful algorithms capable of classifying saccades, fixations, and post-saccadic oscillation as evaluated by \citet{Andersson2017} was an adaptive, velocity-based algorithm proposed by \citet{Nystrom2010AnData}. Even though the algorithm performed poorly on dynamic stimuli, its classification performance was good for static stimulation. The algorithm, henceforth referred to as \textit{NH}, detects fixations, saccades, and post-saccadic oscillations (termed "glissades"), and determines the velocity threshold used in classification based on the data's noise level. We initially tried to apply the NH algorithm with no modifications to our eye gaze data. This however yielded implausible results. For example, the average and median durations of eye movements classed as fixations exceeded durations reported in the literature \citep{holmqvist2011eye}; \citep{dorr2010variability}\todo{fix this type of citation. in my own templates, I use npcite for this} by up to factor 2. Additionally, especially for noisy data, the NH algorithm classified too few fixations, as remarked previously by \citet{Friedman2018} already, because it discarded potential fixation events that contained artifacts such as blinks. Consequently, the NH algorithm was unsuitable for our noisy, but precious data. Therefore, based on our use case in the studyforrest dataset, we set out to extend and enhance the algorithm for use with --- potentially noisy --- data from dynamic stimulation. \\
The aim of this article is to describe the resulting data-driven algorithm for robust results from dynamic stimulation. The main novelties of the algorithm stem from areas within the NH algorithm we identified to be worthy of improvement. \todo{outline briefly what our algorithms does that is missing so far}  \\ For one, the algorithm is capable of detecting \textit{smooth pursuits}. These slow motions of the eye during tracking of a moving target are routinely evoked by moving visual objects during dynamic stimulation (CITATION). If this type of eye movement is not properly detected and labeled, erroneous fixation and saccade events (which smooth pursuits would be classified into instead)  are introduced. \cite{Andersson2017} conclude that fixation and saccade detectors achieve acceptable overall accuracy rates, but that great improvements could be provided by implementing support for smooth pursuit movements. Up to now, contemporary algorithms rarely provide this functionality (but see e.g. \cite{LARSSON2015145}; \cite{Komogortsev2013} as existing algorithms with smooth pursuit detection\todo{list smooth pursuit detecting algorithms and find out whether they have deficiencies for dynamic stimuli} ). Secondly, to work with noisy data, an improved algorithm needs to derive biologically plausible events despite the presence of artifacts. The classification of events despite short intermediate periods of data loss corresponds to strategies of human expert coders as well \citep{Hooge2018}. Therefore, as an additional novel criterion in algorithm evaluation, the algorithm must display good detection performance under differing noise conditions. Thirdly, the algorithm needs to take known deficiencies and shortcomings of the NH algorithm into account. For this, we additionally factor the findings of a recent publication by \cite{Friedman2018} in to our own algorithm. \todo[inline]{identify a number of areas we wanted to improve: smooth pursuit detection; do something with the artifacts (recall what exactly...), check a few old github issues for more insights...}

\todo[inline]{We need to elaborate a bit on parameters, and amount of configurable parameters. Maybe also add what type (dispersion or velocity? I believe we combine both of these types). add advantages with regard to parameter selection: Minimum user supply: Pixel conversion factor \& sampling rate. few subjective settings as in NH, intelligent internal decisions based on data characteristics, yet many options to configure based on use case}

The resulting implementations of and improvements in these identified targets for algorithm performance and evaluation make the resulting algorithm --- termed \textit{REMoDNav} (robust eye movement detection for natural viewing) --- a novel tool for eye event classification in dynamic stimulation.
Lastly, in order to facilitate its usage and to remove barriers in software retrieval, the \remodnav algorithm is documented and packaged in an accessible and open-source Python module REMoDNaV. \\

In order to evaluate REMoDNaVs classification performance, we undertook a number of analyses. To investigate whether \remodnav maintains the NHs accuracy with static images, and shows improved performance with dynamic stimuli, we compare its output to that of the NH algorithm and manual human annotation of eye movements for manually labeled data used by \cite{Andersson2017}. Furthermore, as our primary use case stems from noisy data obtained from natural viewing, we demonstrate the algorithms ability to compute robust results even for low-quality data. We investigate this by comparing algorithm performance between the high qualitiy studyforrest eye tracking dataset, and low quality dataset.
 with high quality different qualities, but from the same underlying stimulation.

%TODO:Elaborate to include different approaches that current algorithms took use?


\section*{Methods}\label{methods}
%Methods (3 sections; our algo, comparison to current algos, application on studyforrest dataset)


\subsection*{\remodnav Implementation}\label{impl}
 
%\todo[inline]{\textit{Elaborate on how the algorithm works;For software tool papers, this section should address how the tool works and any relevant technical details required for implementation of the tool by other developers.}}

The algorithm consists of two major steps: Preprocessing and event detection. Figure \ref{fig:alg} displays a pseudo-code based overview of the procedures.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Preprocessing}

 To prevent extreme changes in the raw data, a heuristic spike filter \citep{stampe1993} is applied. Based on filtered coordinates, sampling rate of the eye tracker, viewing distance and screen dimensions (provided with \texttt{px2deg}), \remodnav calculates the velocity and acceleration of eye movements. We enforce a configurable maximum velocity (\texttt{max\_vel}), with samples exceeding the threshold being replaced by this set value, to disregard biologically implausible measurements.
 At this stage, a variety of optional functionality is also available. On demand, the algorithm can: 
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item Mask data around signal loss (such as eye blinks)
 	\item Apply Savitzky-Golay filter (for noise reduction) 
 	\item Apply median filter (for noise reduction)
 \end{enumerate}
 Following any optional filtering we recompute movement velocities. \\

\item{Event detection}

 \textbf{A)} \remodnav classifies events based on velocities in a sequential procedure. The entire time series is chunked into intervals between major saccades (termed SACC) to be able to accommodate data without a short trial structure. Major saccades are located in a data-driven, iterative procedure based on thresholding velocities with a critical velocity value, adapted from the NH algorithm. The threshold is determined from the entire input data to take global noise levels into account: Starting from an initial velocity threshold (\texttt{velthres\_startvelocity}, termed $PT_1$ in NH), the \textit{median} (m) and \textit{median absolute deviation} (MAD) velocity of samples below this value is computed. Iteratively, $PT_i$ is updated following $PT_n = m + noisefactor * MAD$, where the noisefactor is user-configurable, until the difference between two updates is less than $|PT_n - PT_{n-1}| < 1^\circ/sec$. This formula is adapted from the NH algorithm, but, unlike NH, relies on robust statistic instead of mean and standard deviation, which are more appropriate given the skewness of velocity data (see \cite{Friedman2018}). For each resulting saccade peak (sorted by magnitude), \remodnav detects saccade onset, saccade offset and PSOs. Saccadic on- and offset detection is again adapted from NH and based on a velocity criterion, but determines on- and offset thresholds in the temporal vicinity around a respective candidate window. By default, this is from one second before to one second after the window boundaries. PSO detection is more detailed as in the NH algorithm. In their paper, \cite{Nystrom2010AnData} define two mutually exclusive types of "glissades": low-velocity and high-velocity PSOs. High-velocity PSOs display velocities above the peak saccade threshold at least once (i.e. display a velocity peak that would qualify it as a saccade), while low-velocity PSOs only rise above saccade offset thresholds at least once. Despite this distinction, the NH algorithm does not differentiate between the two event types. \remodnav distinguishes these, and labels the PSOs of major saccades as high-velocity (HPSO) or low-velocity (LPSO) depending on the criterion of the NH algorithm.
 
 Importantly, major saccade detection is terminated earlier if a maximum saccade frequency across the entire input data is reached --- this value is configurable (\texttt{max\_initial\_saccade\_freq}) and by default is set to \unit[2]{Hz} \\
 
 \textbf{B} In a locally adaptive manner, remaining data is classified into events \textit{between} the initial major saccades, so called \textit{intersaccade windows}. Additionally, intersaccade windows are further subdivided into segments without any missing data. Therefore, missing data can not disrupt event detection, and excluded segments are not labeled. A saccade in these intervals (termed ISAC) is detected using a local velocity threshold --- determined as in A) but from the specific time window only --- and if its duration exceeds the minimum saccade length and is within a certain minimum distance from neighboring saccades (default: \unit[130]{ms}). Saccade on- and offsets, and low-velocity (ILPS) and high-velocity (IHPS) PSOs are computed as in A).\
 After saccade detection, for all remaining unlabeled time windows longer than a configured minimum duration (default: \unit[40]{ms}), velocities are recomputed after low-pass filtering with a Butterworth filter (default cutoff: \unit[4]{Hz}). Any segments exceeding a maximum pursuit velocity threshold are labeled as smooth pursuits, while everything else is labeled as fixations. Pursuit on/offset detection employs the same algorithm as NHs saccade on/offset algorithm, but with a configurable, fixed velocity threshold (default: \unit[2]{deg/s}).

\end{figure*}

All available parameters (sorted by algorithm step) with their description and, if applicable, default value, are listed in table \ref{tab:parameters} and displayed in figure \ref{fig:alg}. While input required by the user is minimal (raw data, sampling rate, viewing distance and screensize), the amount of configurable parameters may seem large. However, this is implemented on purpose.
The available literature on eye event detection algorithms suggests that there is no true "one-fits-all" solution for event detection. As evident from many evaluations and applications of algorithms (e.g. \cite{Andersson2017}, \cite{Larsson2013}, \cite{Zemblys2018}, \cite{5523936}), different underlying stimulation, data characteristics, or use cases make certain algorithms more suitable than others, hard-coded thresholds and parameters either applicable or detrimental, or potentially require changes to the default values or parameters. We here report results obtained with the default parameter values, unless otherwise stated. But we cannot anticipate how the data from other groups or paradigms looks like. \remodnav therefore employs a broad range of interpretable, adjustable parameters with default values justified from physiological findings/biological limitations, and no hard-coded values. This gives users an option to adjust the algorithm to their data's characteristics, but offers a sensible starting point with defaults that proofed to work well with the different datasets we evaluated the algorithm on. Only velocity thresholds for saccade detection are estimated iteratively from the data. Apart from the advantage of taking noise levels into account, this also follows the reasoning of \cite{Nystrom2010AnData} that uninformed adjustments of this parameter can have vast consequences on saccade detection, and, subsequently, the labeling of all other eve events. However, while the NH algorithms implementation relied on threshold updates from \textit{mean} values of highly skewed data characteristics (as \cite{Friedman2018} pointed out), we compute it from robust median and median absolute deviation (mad) measures. This allows a robust velocity thresholding, adjustable to either global (for major saccade detection) or local (for event detection between major saccades) noise.

%In the original study, Hanke et. al \cite{Hanke.2016} split 30 participants into groups of 15 and placed one half in a fMRI scanner set-up and the other in a lab setting while recording eye movements during the two hour movie stimulus. For further technical details please refer to the original article. As part of an unpublished Bachelor project, we compared different filter and saccade detection algorithm combinations. To quantify the precision of the combination, the correlation between peak velocity and amplitude of all saccades, known as the main sequence, and the inherent $r^2$ values were computed. The higher the data fit to the assumed main sequence $MS$ curve $MS=mx^n$ the more precise the filter-algorithm option. The combination of Savitzky-Golay filter and an adaptive detection algorithm by Nystr√∂m and Holmqvist proved to be most precise and was used for further analysis. The respective algorithm employs a daten-driven threshold which automatically adjusts to local noise levels. It consists of five steps including filtering with Savitzgy-Golay, peak saccade detection, saccade on- and offset determination, as well as glissade and fixation identification. Parameters used for computation were kept exactly as suggested by the authors. According to the algorithm, after detecting saccades and follow-up glissades, the left over movements between saccades were considered fixations. Due to higher noise in dynamic stimuli and the longer recording period this assumption did not hold in the studyforrest dataset. Therefore, an additional velocity limit of 6.58 $\frac{\circ}{s}$ and amplitude of 2 $^\circ$ during a fixation was integrated as these values are commonly viewed as fixation thresholds.\cite{Holmqvist.2011,Henderson.1997}

%Methods should include a brief discussion of allowances made (if any) for controlling bias or unwanted sources of variability, and the limitations of the datasets.



%\todo[inline]{\textit{brief description of the nature and amount of data released, and in which format it is released in}}
%The data is divided into lab and scanner data and released as separate text files for each movie segment per participant. This results in a set of 240 .txt files. The first step of the detection process includes disregarding biologically implausible values and blinks followed up by  Savitzky-Golay filtering. The output files display the velocity, acceleration, point in time and pixel coordinates for each sample and are released separately to enable additional calculations. These files are then further processed to detect saccades, glissades and fixations. The final output includes the typical eye tracking information on each movement event: time and coordinates for on- and offset, amplitude, peak velocity and average velocity. (peak velocity was not calculated for fixations)  

\subsection*{Operation}\label{op}

\remodnav\ is free and open-source software, written in the Python language and
released under the terms of the MIT license. In addition to the Python standard
library it requires the Python packages
NumPy \citep{oliphant2006guide},
Matplotlib \citep{hunter2007matplotlib},
statsmodels \citep{seabold2010statsmodels},\todo{the - in the years here is wrong}
and SciPy \citep{JOP+2001} as software dependencies.
Furthermore, DataLad \citep{HH+2013},
and Pandas \citep{mckinney2010data} have to be available for assessing
correct operation via the \remodnav\ test battery. \remodnav\ itself,
and all software dependencies are available on all major operating systems.
There are no particular hardware requirements for running the software
other than sufficient memory to load and process the data.



\section*{Validation analyses}\label{ana}
%
%\todo[inline]{three major types of comparison: with andersson human labeling, stats of forrest lab recording with andersson video data stats, forrest lab vs forrest mri stats. the goal is to show that we are similar to humans, as good (or better) as other algorithms (by comparison with scores in andersson2017), and proceduce "similar" results on a different movie dataset, and similar results across two different qualities of recordings with the same stimulus (lab vs MRI). No more, no less IMHO. This all translates to three use cases: trial-by-trial data (from anderson), good movie data without trial structure (forrest lab), bad movie data (forrest mri)}

%THIS SECTION  WILL BASICALLY SHOW THE INPUTS AND THE OUTPUTS(RESULTS BASICALLY)
%\todo[inline]{\textit{Testing and comparison --- explaining rationale of the compared algorithms ie they were winners in the anderson paper}}
We applied our algorithm to two datasets, each to fulfill different objectives. First, in order to validate REMoDNaV, we used the manually annotated dataset from the Humanities Lab, Lund University, used by \cite{Andersson2017}\footnote{obtained from https://github.com/richardandersson/EyeMovementDetectorEvaluation}, to see how our algorithm compared against the NH algorithm it is based on and manual human annotation of eye gaze events. This was done to verify that changes introduced in \remodnav do not decrease performance below that of the NH algorithm, and to evaluate whether REMoDNaV indeed improves eye movement detection during dynamic stimulation as intended. Secondly, we used our algorithm on the studyforrest dataset \citep{Hanke2016} to see the results of dynamic stimuli under two different noise conditions: A high-quality dataset from a laboratory setting, and low-quality data from a simultaneous fMRI and eye gaze acquisition. This analysis was used to provide a demonstration of the robustness of the algorithm results. As the stimulus (the Hollywood movie "Forrest Gump") is the same in both noise conditions, it should evoke similar gaze characteristics regardless of the quality of its measurement. Should \remodnav extract similar eye event properties, then this is a good indicator of robust performance even under high noise conditions.

\subsection*{Evaluation of the algorithm: comparing outputs against human coders and a current algorithm}\label{ana_1}

The dataset provided by \citep{Andersson2017} consists of monocular eye gaze data produced from viewing stimuli from three distinct categories --- images, moving dots and videos. In addition to the eye tracking metadata (eye tracker sampling rate (500hz), size of the screen, raw eye gaze data, distance from screen) and eye gaze data (coordinates), each frame was also labeled by two human observers to assign the event they thought it was. A total of six different labels were used, namely, fixation, saccade, post-saccadic oscillation, smooth pursuit, blink and undefined (a sample that did not fit any other category). A minor labeling mistake reported in \cite{Zemblys2018} was fixed prior to the computations. \\
To compare the REMoDNaV results to the human coders and the performance of the NH  algorithm, we applied \remodnav to the Humanities lab dataset and followed the approach by \citet{Andersson2017}: For one, for each stimulus category, we computed the proportion of misclassification per event type compared to each of the human coders, and comparing human coders against each other. A time point classified by \remodnav counted as "misclassified" if the associated event did not correspond to the label the human coder assigned. We limited this analysis to all time points that have been labeled as fixation, saccade, PSO, or pursuit by any method, hence ignoring the rarely used NaN/blinks or "undefined" category. In order to provide a comparison to NH and the other algorithms in \cite{Andersson2017}, this misclassification analysis was repeated excluding samples labeled as pursuit (as none of the algorithms classed this category). The results of this analysis are displayed in table \ref{tab:mclf}. For the comparison performed by \citet{Andersson2017}, the NH algorithm disagreed with human coders in 32\% of samples for images, in 93\% of samples for moving dots, and in 70\% of samples for videos. By comparison, if smooth pursuit movements are not taken into account, our algorithm disagreed far less with each of the human coders. The highest disagreement across all stimuli categories and coders is 11.7\%. If taking smooth pursuit movements into account, the misclassification ratio increases, but remains comparably low, thus exceeding the performance of all contemporary algorithms in \citet{Andersson2017} in the dots and video category. Figure \ref{fig:conf} displays the resulting confusion matrices with Jaccard indices quantifying the similarity between classification decisions.\todo{cite JI appropriately, @all: PLEASE check explanation of the JI ;-)} The Jaccard index (JI) is bound in range [0, 1] with higher values indication higher similarity. A value of 0.93 in the upper left cell of the very first matrix in figure \ref{fig:conf} for example indicates that 93\% of frames that are labeled as a fixation by human coders RA and MN are the same. This index allows to quantify the similarity of classifications independent from values in other cells. While the highest similarity in labeling (evident from high values along the diagonal) exists between human coders, the algorithm still performs well. Especially in the moving dot category, smooth pursuit detection is very consistent to human labels (JI of .73 and .7, respectively), and still good in the video category (JI of .43 and .47, respectively). \\

Additionally, we determined counts, mean and standard deviation of the extracted eye movements, and computed the root mean squared deviations (RMSD) for \remodnav against the human coders per stimulus category. The RMSD is proposed by \cite{Andersson2017} as a single similarity measure of event parameters to rank algorithms according to their similarity to human coders. The RMSD measure has a lower bound of 0 and higher values denote higher deviations, but for a thorough explanation of the measure and the procedures necessary for its computation, please refer to the original publication by \cite{Andersson2017}. By computing the RMSD of \remodnav on the same data, we are able to compare the similarity of \remodnav to human labeling with those reported in \cite{Andersson2017}, and thus rank \remodnav within the original set of algorithms. \todo[inline]{\textit{Table (or a graphic?) showing duration mean, SD, count and RMSD (tables 3-4, Anderson) for images, dots and videos }}
The "best" algorithm with regard to saccade and PSO detection in \cite{Andersson2017}, the "LNS" algorithm by \cite{Larsson2013}, achieved RMSDs between 0.2 and 0.3 for saccades, and RMDS between 1.0 and 1.2 for PSOs. Different algorithms performed "best" for fixation detection given the category. The NH algorithm achieved RMSD = 0.4 for images and RMSD = 0.8 for videos, but RMSD = 2.1 for dots. TODO: now how do we do?
\todo[inline]{compute RMSD for algo comparison}\todo[inline]{how do we compare against the "best" LNS algorithm in Andersson2017?}

IF we go for Cohens Kappa: The "best" algorithm with regard to saccade and PSO detection in \cite{Andersson2017}, the "LNS" algorithm by \cite{Larsson2013}, achieved Cohens Kappas between .75 and .81 for saccades, and RMSDs between .59 and .64 for PSOs. The "best" algorithms with regard fixations had RMSDs between .5 and .7 for the image category, but at maximum .13 for any of the dynamic categories. TODO: now how do we do? \\

The combined results of the analyses on the dataset used by \citet{Andersson2017} demonstrate that \remodnav yields the highest congruency to manual human annotation during dynamic stimulation compared to ten contemporary algorithms. The results further reveal that REMoDNaVs performance equals or exceeds those of the original NH or other algorithms, even within categories that were those other algorithms singular strong points.

The goal is to have as much information as possible be contained in figures and/or tables (and their captions). We don't pay for those, but we do pay for the main text body.}}

To determine whether \remodnav yields biologically plausible results, we applied it to the high quality eye tracking dataset obtained from 15 subjects watching the movie in a laboratory setting. Eye movements in this dataset were recorded with an Eyelink 1000 with a standard desktop mount (software version 4.51; SR Research Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and a sampling rate of 1000Hz. The movie stimulus was presented on a $522$x$294$mm LCD monitor at a resolution of $1920$ x $1280$px at a viewing distance of 85cm \citep{Hanke2016}.\todo{discuss: have the acquisition data in a combined, separate paragraph?}

The top panel in figure \ref{fig:remodnav} displays the performance of \remodnav for a high quality data sample. Individual main sequences for two lab subjects are displayed in the bottom panel in figure \ref{fig:mains}. We then computed the eye event characteristics per category to compare them to the results of \cite{Andersson2017}, known properties about these eye movements during movie watching, and their biological upper and lower limits. These results are summarized in table \todo[inline]{TODO (have a table for fixations, saccades, PSOs as Anderson, maybe also smooth pursuits)} \todo[inline]{Asim recalled Michael wanted to do those tables.

\subsection*{Low-quality data}\label{ana_3}

In order to determine the robustness of \remodnav to noise, in a last step, we applied it to the low quality eye tracking dataset of the studyforrest publication. This data was recorded with a different Eyelink 1000 (software version 4.594) equipped with an MR-compatible telephoto lens and illumination kit (SR Research Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) at $1000$Hz during simultaneous fMRI acquisition. The movie was presented at a viewing distance of $63$cm on a 26cm ($1280$ x $1024$px) LCD screen in 720p resolution at full width. The eye tracking camera was mounted outside the scanner bore and recorded the participants left eye at a distance of about 100cm \citep{Hanke2016}. \todo[inline]{maybe elaborate on how higher noise is visible in the data...N+H describe: "Data quality is related to accuracy, precision, percentage of data loss, perhaps in addition to a subjective rating from the person responsible for the recording"}

Figure \ref{fig:remodnav} displays the performance of \remodnav for a low quality data sample in the bottom row. Individual main sequences for two MRI subjects are displayed in the bottom panel in figure \ref{fig:mains}. As the stimulus material was the same between the high and low quality data sample, \remodnav demonstrates robust performance if the characteristics of extracted events within the low dataset correspond to those obtained from the previous high quality data sample. The resulting characteristics are depicted in tables \todo[inline]{Same as above} \todo[inline]{elaborate on an example within the figure about how data loss within e.g. fixation periods do not interfere much}

The assumed shape of the distribution indicates a gradual decrease to the left, implying the possibility of a number of shorter, yet disregarded saccades. This loss of data can easily be fixed by choosing a less conservative duration threshold. There are many different subjective opinions on minimum saccadic duration, ranging from 10 ms \cite{Duchowski.2007} to 15 ms \cite{Smith.2013}. A more objective approach was provided by Carpenter in 1988 who found a mathematical relation between duration and amplitude of saccades \cite{Carpenter.1988}: $duration=2.2\cdot{}amplitude+21$. According to this equation there are no saccades of less than 21 $ms$. Therefore, a minimum duration of 21 $ms$ was chosen as threshold.}

%\caption[]{Movie segment analysis for glissades and fixations, showing mean values for different metrics over every test subject per segment, mean value of duration, amplitude, velocity, and number of fixations. Since glissade durations group around the cut off value of 40, it seems that most movements would have been longer than that. This indicates, that the threshold for glissade detection is too low, perceivably because the data used had a higher level of baseline noise than in the experiment by Nystr√∂m and Holmqvist.{\cite{Nystrom.2010}} Fixation durations range around a mean value of 420.42 $ms$. Typical values for fixations rarely exceed 400 $ms$. However, the significantly longer fixation durations align with the rest of the eye movements, as saccades were accordingly shorter than typical values suggest. Human gaze in general is preferably directed at the center of the stimulus {\cite{Buswell.1935,Parkhurst.2002}} and the pull towards the center was proven to be strongest in professionally cut Hollywood movie trailers when compared with natural scenes or static images. {\cite{Dorr.2010}} These findings supports the assumption, that participants mainly focused on the center of the screen, which is backed uo by the data. Fixations include small microsaccades, tremor and slow drifts, which allow the viewer to gradually explore the movie stimulus while staying within fixation parameter boundaries.}

Applying the detection procedure to the rest of data produced similar results. Before computing any t-test comparisons, participants with the IDs 2 and 5 were removed from the scanner data pool. As mentioned in the original study,\footnote{\cite{Hanke.2016}} a large amount of data was lost in their recording session due to signal loss, leaving too little information to detect enough saccades for valid correlation measures. Although there are slight differences in accuracy for the scanner data, the precision level prevails similarly high as for the lab. In direct comparison to the lab data, with a t-test criterion of 0.05, 3 movie segments do not show significant differences in detection accuracy. However, after applying the Bonferroni-Method \footnote{\cite{Abdi.2007}} the detection precision for merely two movie segments is substantially less accurate for scanner data in comparison to lab recordings (highlighted).}

\section*{Conclusion}\label{con}
Based on the adaptive, velocity-based algorithm for fixation, saccade, and
glissade detection by \cite{Nystrom2010AnData}, we have developed a novel,
robust algorithm for the classification of various eye movements in eye tracking
data from dynamic stimulation.
The combined results from all analyses are encouraging. Based on data from dynamic and static stimulation from the Andersson dataset, \remodnav performs well and even outperforms contemporary algorithms, and this is especially true for dynamic stimulation. A contributing factor to its good performance for dynamic stimuli is that \remodnav was created with the explicit objective to classify smooth pursuit eye movements. This is undoubtedly an advantage for event detection on data from dynamic stimulation, but also a capability that most contemporary algorithms lack, and thus a valuable extension to the currently established open-source detection algorithms. Therefore, we are confident that \remodnav is currently a good choice for event detection from eye gaze data obtained during dynamic stimulation. Furthermore, the algorithm yields similar, and thus robust, results for high and low quality data. We specifically developed \remodnav to yield robust results with dynamic stimulation, in particular noisy data such as the eye tracking data recorded simultaneously to fMRI acquisition. These results confirm that \remodnav is well able to detect eye movements from dynamic stimulation, even when the quality of data is low. Therefore, the algorithm is a promising tool for research paradigms with dynamic stimuli where lower data quality is an inherent property of the acquisition procedure, such as simultaneous fMRI and eye gaze recordings, or usage of remote eye trackers.

Furthermore, the algorithm proofed to be well applicable to other types of stimulation. Its classification performance for
as well. \todo[inline]{elaborate on results on Andersons datasets, and include how
	the algorithm performs comparable to human coders and contemporary algorithms (or even
	exceeds their performance)}.\\
As such, REMoDNaV is a versatile tool that provides researchers with a robust
method to classify eye movements obtained from different types of stimulation.
\todo[inline]{note a few advantages that relate to usability of the algorithm:
	freely available, platform independent, simple command-line execution, minimum
	user input required, adaptivity to the noise level of the data, ..  (i need to
	read into how the algorithm is executed again)}



\textbf{TODO: Discuss Limitations:}

Just as \cite{Andersson2017}, we considered human annotations to be a gold standard in event detection when we compared different algorithms performances. The implications of the obtained results from this comparison are hence only valid if this assumption is warranted. Some authors voice concern about human annotation, e.g. \cite{5523936}, as for the potential of biases that limit generalizability. However, \cite{Hooge2018} concluded that - despite obvious variability between human annotations - manual labeling is certainly important in algorithm validation as undertaken in our study. Continuing in the same vein, the \remodnav algorithm is - as all event detection algorithms - far from perfect. Despite superior performance during dynamic stimulation compared to other algorithms, the results do not mirror human annotations exactly. Therefore, as with any other algorithm, we recommend that every user should at least eye-ball their results for plausibility. One straightforward way to do this is to study the classification performance as shown in figure \ref{fig:remodnav}. The \remodnav module will provide such a plot automatically for every detection task, enabling researchers to detect implausible results early on. \\



\cite{munn2008fixation} found velocity-based algorithms to perform well in fixation detection during dynamic stimulation.

Remark on the main sequence plots; they look like there are little deviating saccades (which could be PSOs or glissades)

\cite{Komogortsev2013} also successfully employed a combined velocity and dispersion criterion for smooth pursuit identification.

\section*{Notes} % Optional - only if NO new datasets are included
%This section is required if the paper does not include novel data or analyses.  It allows authors %to briefly summarize the key points from the article. 



"With both dispersion- and velocity-based algorithms, the effect of imprecision can to some extent be alleviated by raising the threshold setting. With a larger dispersion radius, or a higher velocity threshold, sample-to-sample motion can be quicer without enagering the consistency pf fixations. The remedy comes at a price, however. For instance, rasing a velocity threshold above peaks of imprecision will make it so high that some saccades will not be identified."

Problems of current algorithms with low quality data: "Lack of temproal criterion for fixation duration, lack of upper velocity threshold"

Argument pro velocity based criteria (compared to dispersion): Dispersion based algorithms are suspectible to noise and loss of spatiotemporal precision, for velocity based algorithms, filter and thresholds can eradicate implausible accelerations, Nystr√∂m \& Holmqvist (book) conclude that velocity algorithms have "good potential for the entire spectrum of [eye tracker] sampling frequencies"



\todo[inline]{from andersson: How does the number of detected events and their
  durations vary with the choice of an algorithm? How similar are the events
  detected by algorithms compared to events manually identified by human
  experts? How similar are algorithms and humans in a simple sample-by-sample
  comparison, which is the most human-like? How similar are our two human
  coders? Are they interchangeable, or will the event detection process depend
  on the human experts we use?  Does the algorithm ‚Äì human or human ‚Äì human
  similarity depend on the stimuli used for eliciting the eye movement data,
  i.e. will it differ between static and dynamic stimuli?  What are the
  consequences of trying to detect events in the presence of smooth pursuit
  using improper, i.e. not designed to handle smooth pursuit, algorithms? Is
  this a serious violation, or will such a use provide acceptable
  approximations of the properties of the true (human-identified) events?  How
  congruent are different evaluation techniques, such as similarity based on
  event durations, compared to similarity based on Cohen's Kappa?  Given that
  algorithms do not classify identically with human experts, what types of
  deviating classifications do the algorithms do? Are the deviations random, or
  do they indicate a clear bias in some direction? What area should developers
  focus on improving, to gain the highest marginal improvement (i.e.,
  similarity to humans) of the algorithm?  }
